# Communal Living and Household Chores Sharing App

Welcome to my pet project! This application is designed to make communal living easier by allowing users to create, manage, and track household chores schedules. It's a web app that lets you create a schedule, manage it, invite your friends, and naturally track household chores.

The project is divided into two main parts: the frontend and the backend. 

## Frontend

The frontend of the application is written in React with Tailwind CSS for styling. It was bootstrapped with Create React App (CRA), and includes some animations made with tailwind-animated. You can find more information about the frontend in the frontend README.

## Backend

The backend of the application is written in Go, either vanilla or using the Gin framework, and uses MySQL for data storage. It includes a REST API, Docker support, an authorization system based on Argon2id. You can find more information about the backend in the backend README.
